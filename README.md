# SharePoint-PowerShell
PowerShell Scripts for SharePoint.
I've created this project to share useful powershell script for SharePoint Tasks

SCRIPTS
Backup_SiteCollections_And_MetadataNavigation.ps1
RecreateNavigation.ps1
These two scripts must be executed in order. First "Backup_SiteCollections_And_MetadataNavigation.ps1", Second "RecreaateNavigation.ps1".
The first do a backup the second do a restauration of navigations terms.
